A clock clock 24 is a kinetic sculpture and functional wall clock created by the Swedish design studio Humans.

WHAT I HAVE DONE
-> The user can chose the no of clocks
-> The starting time (in minutes i.e 60 = 1 PM)
-> Time interval between each clock

WHAT I WANT TO DO
-> Display the local time and temperature through multiple clocks, with each clock representing a different component of the time and temperature
-> Attractive Patterns
