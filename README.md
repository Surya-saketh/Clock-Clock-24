Clock Clock 24, a kinetic sculpture and functional wall clock designed by the Swedish studio Humans, inspired me to create a software-based version of it.

**What I have done:**

Created a replica of Clock Clock 24 where the user can choose:
- The number of clocks
- The starting time (in minutes, e.g., 60 = 1 PM)
- The time interval between each clock

Here, There are 30 clocks, initital time of each clock is 60 i.e 1 PM and the time interval between each clock is 3 minutes

WHAT I WANT TO DO
-> Display the local time and temperature through multiple clocks, with each clock representing a different component of the time and temperature
-> Attractive Patterns
