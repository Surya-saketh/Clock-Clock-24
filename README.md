Clock Clock 24, a kinetic sculpture and functional wall clock designed by the Swedish studio Humans, where time is displayed using individual analog clocks to collectively display a digital time through the coordinated movement of their hands. 
Inspired me to create a software based version of it.

**WHAT I HAVE DONE:**

Created a replica of Clock Clock 24 where the user can choose:
- The number of clocks
- The starting time (in minutes, e.g., 60 = 1 PM)
- The time interval between each clock

Here, There are 30 clocks, initital time of each clock is 60 i.e 1 PM and the time interval between each clock is 3 minutes

**WHAT I WANT TO DO:**


- Display the local time and temperature through multiple clocks, where individual analog clocks to collectively display a locak time and temperature through the coordinated movement of their hands.
